Recommendations for home sellers and/or buyers in King County

First-Project
This repository is about to suggest to potential buyer through a thorough statistical research, a house nearby the downtown of Seattle. We evaluate different values from our dataset, like number of bedrooms/bathrooms, wie, sqft, prices and others.

1. Setup
Firt I import the libraries

2. Business Understanding 
The second step is to understand our dataframe and how we can drow information for important to give some good examples for our buyer

3. The goal
My target group in the repo will be a married couple or a family belonging in the middle class

4. Data cleening
As next step I get informations from the missing data, and what values need to be changed and delete outliers through statistical observation. Afterwards I take idividaly values under the statistical scope bigining with the price and how it is correlated with the other values. Then I get a closer look to waterfront view, the date the house was sold, the grades and finaly the cordinations and zipcode

5. Feature Engineering
